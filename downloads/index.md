Gotthardt Rising Adventure consists of a server part and a client part. See more at [Installation]({{ site.url }}/downloads/#installation).

> We recommend usage of the Stable Version. The Latest version can be unstable and may corrupt your data. Make backups before using!

##Client

The client part is a ressourcepack which can be installed and activated as every other ressourcepack. Some effects and textures need [Optifine](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1272953-1-8-3-optifine-hd-b1-fps-boost-hd-textures-aa-af)/McPatcher to work properly. See [Installation]({{ site.url }}/downloads/#installation) on how to install this mod.

> Updating this should not damage any data. You can safely update this to safe disk space, because newer packs have optimized file structure. This does **not** decrease quality.

##Installation

This is **not** just a minecraft map. So you **can't** install this like any other adventure map and put it in your `.minecraft/saves/` folder. for this reason this project is not called a **Adventure map**. Its more like an **Adventure System** with many additions to the vanilla minecraft functions (read more at [About]({{ site.url }}/about/)).
This is the reason why its splitted in a server and in a client. The client is nothing more than a ressourcepack with special data that the server interprets. You dont need any mods to play this adventure, but we **highly recommend using Optifine or MCPatcher**, because most esthetical things won't work without this mod (e.g. custom skies, etc.). Please follow the instructions below completely, as we don't support issues related to wrong installation.
